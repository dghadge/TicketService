###  Ticket Service UI : Bootstrap/AngularJS frontend for Ticket Service backend
    Although this is a static application, sometimes you just want the webserver to do work for you like
    redirecting requests to index.html. In static website you will have to find the index.html on the file system
    and load it in the browser

###  How to start the application
     From command prompt run the following commands
     1. git clone https://github.com/dghadge/ticketservice.git
     2. cd dynamic-webui
     2. mvn package 
     3. mvn spring-boot:run  (this command will start the application)
